      # The Changesets action does one of three things
      # 1. Create a release PR, which bumps version numbers and appends to CHANGELOG.md files 
      # 2. If there's already a release PR open, it will update the existing one rather than create a new one
      # 3. Unless the PR we're merging _is_ the release PR; in that case it will publish the packages that were updated
